# Folders Structure

## Task 1. Design a basic service architecture

Imagine that you need to create a simple service that operates with ["Welsh Corgi"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Corgi) entities.
Expected operations:

- Get single corgi
- Get multiple corgis
- Create a new corgi
- Update single corgi
- Delete single corgi

You are expected to:

1. Design service routes for the specified operations
2. Design folders structure
